Phase 3: Carrying out the actions
There are 4 possible types of action which can be carried out. It does not matter how many times or in what order they are carried out.

No dice are used to:
• Lay cards
	However, this action costs money, the exact amount depends on the card.

One action dice is required for each of the three actions:
• Take money
• Take card(s)
• Activate a card

The player decides which of the dice scores thrown in phase 2 he wants to allocate to which of the different actions. It is not possible to divide up the score on one particular die or to allocate one dice score to more than one action.

The actions in detail:
• Laying cards:
	Cards are taken from the player's hand and placed face-up. When laying a card, the player always has to allocate the card to a dice disc. Cards are only placed on the player's own side.
	• Covering cards:
	If a player wants to lay his card next to a dice disc which has already got a card next to it, the card which is already there is removed and put on the discard pile.
	Laying a card costs the number of sestertii shown on the card. A player is only allowed to lay the card if the complete amount has been paid. The money is put in the general stockpile.
• Taking money:
	A player puts one of their action dice on the “money” disc and takes the number of sestertii shown on the die from the stockpile.
• Taking card(s):
	The player places one of their action dice on the “Cards” disc and draws the number of cards scored with the die. The player keeps 1 of these cards in their hand, the rest are discarded face-up. If the pile has been used up, the discarded cards are mixed and placed face-down to form a new pile. Players can have as many cards in their hands as they want.
• Activating a card:
	The player puts one of their action dice on the dice disc showing the same score. This activates the player's card lying next to this disc, i.e. the instructions on the card are carried out. If more than one die shows the same score, the card can in turn be activated more than once. [The instructions for each individual card are given in detail in the appendix on pages 5 and 6.]

Battle
	Some cards enable the player to attack the opponent's cards. If there is a battle, the player whose turn it is – this player is always the attacker – throws the battle die once. If the player rolls a score equal to or higher than the defence value of the card under attack, the attacker wins and the card is discarded. In all other cases nothing happens. If a player has ended their turn, i.e. all their actions have been carried out, play passes to the other player.
